## UCLA-BigML-SpuCo-Assignment
<p>This repository contains the code for the sample SpuCo assignment, which involves training an accurate model on an MNIST dataset that contains spurious features, such as specific background colors amongst certain classes.</p>

## Results
<p>The model that was trained using George performed much better in the evaluation than the model which was trained with no particular sampling.<br>
<br>The original model only performs well on images with the spurious feature.</p>

<p><br>The model which was trained with group-balanced sampling performed well across all types of images.</p>
